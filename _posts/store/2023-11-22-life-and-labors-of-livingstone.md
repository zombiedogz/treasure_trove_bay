## Vintage 1875 Edition: "The Life and Labors His Last Mile of Livingstone" by Rev. J. E. Chambliss (Hardcover)

### Doctor Livingstone, I presume?

This timeless narrative unfolds the remarkable story of David Livingstone, FRGS FRS, a Scottish physician, Congregationalist, and pioneering Christian missionary. A key figure of the London Missionary Society, Livingstone emerged as a celebrated British hero in the late 19th-century Victorian era. Married to Mary Moffat Livingstone, he hailed from the prominent Moffat missionary family of the 18th century. Livingstone's legacy spanned multiple dimensions, casting him as a Protestant missionary martyr, an emblem of "rags-to-riches" inspiration, a scientific investigator, an explorer, an imperial reformer, an anti-slavery advocate, and a proponent of British commercial and colonial expansion.

Central to Livingstone's renown was his quest to uncover the sources of the Nile River. His belief in the power of fame to combat the East African Arabâ€“Swahili slave trade fueled his relentless exploration of the central African watershed. In 1873, he "disappeared" and eventually succumbed in Africa, posthumously becoming a national hero in 1874 and inspiring central African Christian missionary initiatives during the European "Scramble for Africa."

"The Life and Labors His Last Mile of Livingstone," penned by Rev. J. E. Chambliss in 1875, serves as a comprehensive biography. Chambliss vividly recounts the final years (1866-1873) of Livingstone's adventurous life, detailing his pursuit of the Nile's source. Amidst adversities like illness, famine, and hostile encounters, Livingstone's unwavering commitment to his mission shines through.

Chambliss delves into Livingstone's personal sphere, exploring his family life and profound faith. The narrative underscores Livingstone's enduring impact on Africa, focusing on his endeavors to eradicate the slave trade. The author illuminates Livingstone's interactions with African tribes, leaders, and his initiatives to foster commerce and education in the region.

In essence, "The Life and Labors His Last Mile of Livingstone" paints a vivid and inspiring portrait of David Livingstone's concluding years, emphasizing his dedication to exploration, faith, and the betterment of African communities.
