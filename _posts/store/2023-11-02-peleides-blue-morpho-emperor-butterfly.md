__The Peleides Blue Morpho Butterfly__ is a stunning creature, and Deborah "Debbie" Lynn Crist (1949 - 2021) perfectly captures its beauty in her mounted photograph. Crist was a gifted photographer who specialized in nature and wildlife photography, and her images are renowned for their breathtaking quality.

The photograph is a close-up of a Peleides Blue Morpho butterfly, with its wings spread wide to reveal its iridescent blue coloration. The butterfly is stationary, which allows Crist to capture its intricate details, from the delicate veins on its wings to the tiny hairs on its body. The mat is a complementary white color, which helps to highlight the butterfly's beauty even further.

Crist was a master of her craft, and she had a keen eye for detail. She was also a patient and meticulous photographer, and she was willing to wait hours to get the perfect shot. Her passion for photography is evident in her work, and her images are a true testament to her talent.

The Peleides Blue Morpho butterfly is one of the most beautiful and sought-after butterflies in the world. It is found in the rainforests of Central and South America, and its wings can reach up to 8 inches across. The butterfly's iridescent blue coloration is caused by the structure of its scales, which scatter light in a way that creates the appearance of blue.
